The company secured a $1 billion loan from J.P. Morgan Chase and Salomon Smith Barney, pledging its natural gas pipelines as collateral. This move signaled Enron's desperation to reassure investors and trading partners of its creditworthiness. Standard & Poor's downgraded Enron's credit ratings, expressing concerns over the company's financial flexibility and ability to restore its credit quality. The company's stock price plummeted, and there were discussions about potential takeovers or asset sales, including its stake in the Dabhol Power Company in India. The crisis raised concerns about Enron's impact on the energy trading markets and its potential to cause a financial crisis similar to the one experienced after Long-Term Capital Management's failure."

First, the CPUC proposes strict load-differentiated price caps using a formula based on marginal heat rates and an index gas price, which could limit prices to around $100 maximum and as low as $30-40/MWh off-peak. This mechanism is criticized for not recognizing opportunity costs in other markets and rendering commercial hedging arrangements unprofitable. Second, the CPUC requests that all jurisdictional generators and marketers offer forward contracts for a significant portion of their capacity at FERC-regulated rates for 18-36 months, similar to UK and Australian ""vesting contracts"" but without capacity payments. Adamson warns that implementing these proposals would severely restrict the market for up to three years and eliminate potential profits from current long positions. He suggests that a response to the CPUC motion should be considered if FERC's order does not adequately address these issues, as the proposed restrictions are onerous and could negatively impact market participants."
