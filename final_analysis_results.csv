Standard & Poor's has placed California utility holding companies PG&E Corp and Edison International on credit watch with negative implications due to escalating debt from unpaid power supply costs. The situation worsens as wholesale power prices rise, and the ISO narrowly avoids rolling blackouts due to 13 suppliers halting power sales. Kean clarifies that Enron is only a limited buyer and seller in California, offering 70 megawatts to the ISO during the emergency, which was declined. The ISO manages California's electricity grid, purchasing additional power for PG&E, Southern California Edison, and San Diego Gas & Electric, with 70-day payment terms to suppliers.
